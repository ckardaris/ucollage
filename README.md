## Features
- view images and video thumbnails
- renaming
- moving to Trash
- rating
- categories
- editing images supporting undo and redo actions
- fully customizable vim keybindings
- command execution

## Getting Started
- Follow the
  [instructions](https://ucollage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) to
  install `ucollage`.
- Type
  ```bash
  ucollage
  ```
  in a directory with images.
- Use `hjkl` or `arrows` in order to select different images, `Enter` to view
  an image in monocle mode and `Backspace` to go back in the grid. `n` fetches
  the next batch of images and `p` the previous one.

## Documentation
Viewing the images is half the fun. Read the
[documentation](https://ucollage.readthedocs.io/en/stable) in order to explore
the more interesting functionalities that are possible with `ucollage`.

## Contributing
I will gladly accept contributions from any interested parties. I would prefer
most contributions to be targeted towards improving the language of the
documentation, in order for it to be more understandable for the new user of the
software.
